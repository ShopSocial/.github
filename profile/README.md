# ShopSocial
*A Social Platform for a shared shopping experience*

## Problem Statement
- Online shopping has become an integral part of modern life, providing convenience and accessibility.
- However, the experience lacks the social aspect that traditional offline shopping offers, where friends and family can shop together.
- The absence of a collaborative shopping experience on e-commerce platforms has led to a disconnect between the online and offline shopping worlds.
- To bridge this gap, we propose the development of a web plugin that enables group shopping on existing e-commerce websites.

## Our Solution
1. A web plugin designed to seamlessly integrate with existing e-commerce websites.
2. This visionary plugin enables the formation of shopping groups, where users can collectively explore products, engage in real-time discussions, and add items to a shared cart.
3. Embracing the social dynamics of offline shopping, this project aspires to redefine the digital shopping landscape, fostering a sense of community and shared decision-making.
